      <p>My name is Sean Parker.</p>
      <p>Discovering my love for web development in college, I made the transition from journalist to full time coder in 2012. As you can see by my resum&egrave;, I've worked in startups, corporate, and government organizations since then.</p>
      <p>I'm a team player who quickly picks up on how your organization works together, and a self starter who independently gets things done. </p>

      <p>Have a look around at my portfolio, github and linkedin to see how I can fit on your team.</p>
